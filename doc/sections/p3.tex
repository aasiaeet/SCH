\subsubsection{Problem 3: }

Considerable hospital resources are dedicated to minimizing the number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. One tool that is commonly used to achieve this goal is surveillance for MRSA colonization. This process is costly, and false-positive test results lead to isolation of individuals who do not carry MRSA. The performance of this technique would improve if patients who are at high risk of colonization could be readily targeted.
