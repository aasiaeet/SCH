How do we come up with the labels from the data? 

- The simplest way to label is to consider data points only at the admission time or post surgery time. 
- More complicated way of labeling is to label every instance one time window before the incident as one. 


- Homogeneous feature MTL is the first case

Notation:
	MTL is the general framework of handling our problem:Define tasks, homo-features, ...
	Why do we elevate something as a task? (When to share)
		- Domain expert: previously people have considered HAI types separately. 
			- Human expert is the one deciding in the literature.
			- Cross-validation is computationally intensive. 
		- We gain more flexibility and interpretability. 
	
Fast optimization method for solving any of these. 
	
P1: Focus on one facility but predict multiple MDRO infections. 
Talk about the history of multi task learning: parameter, feature ?, instance based sharing. 

	- Time to event (listen to Kevin's comment)
	- 

P2: 
a) Focus on multiple facilities but predict one MDRO: MTL for single MDRO heterogeneous
b) Focus on multiple facilities but predict multiple MDRO: MTL with multiple output MDRO heterogeneous
 - Here we go beyond the known MTL literature
 
P3: Intervention
